Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI

Project Overview
This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) User Interface designed to simplify user and role management within an application. It provides an intuitive interface to manage users, assign roles, and define permissions efficiently. With a responsive design and aesthetic styling, this RBAC UI ensures a seamless experience across devices.

Features:-
User Management: Add, edit, and delete users with ease.
Role Assignment: Assign specific roles to users based on their responsibilities.
Permission Management: Customize permissions for each role.
Responsive Design: Fully optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Interactive Tabs: Clean tabbed navigation for improved usability.
Thematic Styling: A modern aesthetic with gradients, shadows, and hover effects.

Usage Instructions:-
Open the RBAC UI in your browser.
Use the tabs to navigate between different sections (Users, Roles, Permissions).
Click **Add User** to create a new user.
Use the **Edit** and **Delete** buttons to modify or remove users.
Assign roles and permissions via intuitive form controls.
For actions that open modals (like Add/Edit), click outside the modal to close it or use the cancel button.

Explanation of Features :-
Tabs Navigation
The UI is divided into tabs for easier navigation: Users, Roles, and Permissions.
Each tab provides relevant functionality, making it easy to switch contexts without losing focus.

Modal Forms:-
Add and edit actions open modals, providing a focused interface for input.
Forms are styled with responsive layouts and clear labels to enhance usability.
